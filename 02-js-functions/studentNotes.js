// this is where you can take notes without risking merge conflicts when you pull down new code from Github (the remote is called origin => i.e., where your online repo for this directory is located)

// also feel free to use this as a sandbox!

// Running the file ```node notes.js``` (without the backticks) will allow you to explore/play around with code. Make sure you have cd'ed into the inner folder before you do this.
